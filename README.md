I do not have access to the assignment files, nor am I enrolled in the class. But following some basica tutorials from SFML's website, I was able to follow along.

The purpose of the assignment is to read in values from a config file and "load them" into SFML. Those values can be the window size, specific fonts, circles, etc. Then the object will move around the screen at the velocity specified in the file, keeping its name centered the whole time.

Config File Understanding:

Please see the youtube video to understand what each line in the config is looking for. The order can not be rearranged and must follow the same pattern as the video.
